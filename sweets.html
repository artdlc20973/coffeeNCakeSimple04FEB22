  <p>Skittles are multicolored fruit-flavored button-shaped candies produced and marketed by the Wrigley Company,[1] a division of Mars, Inc.
  Skittles consist of hard sugar shells imprinted with the letter 'S', similar to M&M's which have the letter "M". The interior consists mainly of sugar, corn syrup, and hydrogenated palm kernel oil along with fruit juice, citric acid, natural and artificial flavors.[2] Skittles are sold in a variety of flavor collections, such as Tropical, Wild Berry, Dessert, Sweet Heat, Smoothie, and Sour.</p>
  <p>Skittles were first made commercially in 1974 by a British company.[3] The name of the candy, Skittles, comes from the sports game of the same name, named as such for the resemblance of the sweet to items used in the game.[3] They were first introduced in North America in 1979 as an import confectionery.[2] In 1982, domestic production of Skittles began in the United States.[2] </p>
